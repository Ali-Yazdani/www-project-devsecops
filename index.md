## What is the difference between DVSGL and DSOMM?  
Many OWASP project followers often wonder about the differences between these projects and how they can have a better experience with them. This guide aims to provide clarity on these differences and help you make the most out of these projects. By improving our experience with these projects, we can take steps towards making them flagships in the world of DevSecOps.


To achieve a complete DevSecOps process, it's recommended to review the DevSecOps standard by going through **DSOMM** and **DSOGL**. Once you've defined the standard level you wish to achieve, implement it using **DSOGL** and measure it using **DSOMM** to ensure that you're moving in the right direction in line with world standards and your expectations. This approach will help you define your DevSecOps process clearly and effectively. 

**A tip:**   
```To show your progress and be able to present it to high-level management, we recommend keeping track of the changes you make. It's a good idea to have a measurment before implementation and after that another again to see the trend of improvments. This will help you see the improvements you've made clearly and measurably. ```

| **DSOGL**        | **DSOMM** |
| It offers adaptable recommendations and best practices, allowing organizations to customize their security strategies to fit their unique requirements. Emphasizing education and awareness, this initiative fosters a culture of security consciousness within development, security, and operations teams. By providing flexible guidelines, it encourages teams to learn, collaborate, and implement security measures effectively, ensuring a holistic and contextually relevant approach to DevSecOps.  |  provides a structured pathway for organizations to enhance their security practices incrementally. By assessing their current maturity level, organizations can identify specific areas for improvement. This model guides them in planning and implementing incremental enhancements, allowing for continuous growth in their DevSecOps capabilities. It emphasizes a step-by-step approach, enabling organizations to measure progress, adapt to emerging threats, and evolve their security practices over time. Through this gradual process, organizations can build robust DevSecOps frameworks that align with their evolving needs and security challenges.  |
