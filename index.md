## What is the difference between DSOVS, DVSGL, and DSOMM?  
Many OWASP project followers often wonder about the differences between these projects and how they can have a better experience with them. This guide aims to provide clarity on these differences and help you make the most out of these projects. By improving our experience with these projects, we can take steps towards making them flagships in the world of DevSecOps.


If you want to achieve a complete DevSecOps process, you can define the standard level you wish to attain using **DSOVS**. Then, you can implement it using **DSOGL** and measure it using **DSOMM** to ensure that you are moving in the right direction in line with your expectations and world standards.

 OWASP DevSecOps Verification Standard                                  | OWASP DevSecOps Guideline                                             | OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model                                     |

| It provides a set of predefined security controls and requirements, establishing a standardized approach to security assessments. By adhering to this standard, organizations can undergo objective evaluations, allowing for consistent and thorough security assessments across various projects. This stringent approach aids in identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring that software development practices meet industry-established security benchmarks. | It offers adaptable recommendations and best practices, allowing organizations to customize their security strategies to fit their unique requirements. Emphasizing education and awareness, this initiative fosters a culture of security consciousness within development, security, and operations teams. By providing flexible guidelines, it encourages teams to learn, collaborate, and implement security measures effectively, ensuring a holistic and contextually relevant approach to DevSecOps.  |  provides a structured pathway for organizations to enhance their security practices incrementally. By assessing their current maturity level, organizations can identify specific areas for improvement. This model guides them in planning and implementing incremental enhancements, allowing for continuous growth in their DevSecOps capabilities. It emphasizes a step-by-step approach, enabling organizations to measure progress, adapt to emerging threats, and evolve their security practices over time. Through this gradual process, organizations can build robust DevSecOps frameworks that align with their evolving needs and security challenges.  |
